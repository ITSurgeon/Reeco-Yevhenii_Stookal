• Bake at 374°F for 17-20 minutes. The stated baking temperature is given as a guideline; the optimal temperature may vary from oven to oven
• Store at -0.4°F: it’s important to keep the temperature as constant as possible
• Always store the products in a closed bag to prevent them from drying out
• Respect the ""First expired first out"" rule: use the products with the shortest shelf life first
• Never use steam when baking Danish pastries to keep the pastry crisp
• Allow the products to cool down sufficiently on the baking tray before serving them
• Defrosted products must never be refrozen

• To preserve the authentic, handmade appearance, these donuts are packaged by hand to maintain product integrity and prevent flattening.

Multiple variety bag - three varieties per bag. Varieties include Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, Gala and/or Fuji. The Granny Smith has a distinctive green skin and is most notably known for its tart, but well-balanced flavor. An all-purpose apple, the Granny Smith is excellent as a snack, in salads, pies and sauces, but its flavor really comes through when baked or sautéed. The Fuji apple is sweet and flavor forward - it is one of the sweetest apples in the world! It is both very crisp and extremely juicy. This apple is perfect for fresh snacking, salads, sauces, beverages and freezing. The Red Delicious is the quintessential red apple. A well-known favorite that’s popular for its tried-and-true flavor: mildly sweet and crunchy. This variety is primarily used as a fresh snacking apple. The Golden Delicious is known for its tender, gold skin, and mild, sweet, yet well-balanced flavor. It is the preferred ‘all-purpose’ cooking apple because its firm, white flesh retains its shape, and mellow flavor when baked or cooked. The Gala apple is crisp, juicy and very sweet. It can vary in color, but it has a very distinctive yellow-orange skin with red striping. While it is ideal for snacking, this variety is also great in salads, baking, pies and sauces.
